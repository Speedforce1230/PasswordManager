Qt Widgets Project - Scalable UI Framework
Overview
This project is a modular Qt Widgets application designed with scalability and efficiency in mind. It utilizes a QStackedWidget-based navigation system, a centralized cache for UI elements, and a custom animation framework to deliver a smooth and expandable interface.

Features
âœ… Modular Navigation System â€“ Easily switch between frames using a structured caching system. âœ… Centralized Resource Management â€“ Handles QSS styles, UI components, and animations efficiently. âœ… Smooth UI Effects â€“ Hover and click animations using QPropertyAnimation. âœ… Expandable Framework â€“ Designed to scale by adding new frames without modifying core architecture.

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
C++ (at least C++20 recommended)

Qt 6.x (or latest stable Qt version)

CMake

Building the Project
bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./your-executable-name

Future Enhancements
ðŸ“Œ Persistent caching implementation (maintain states across sessions). ðŸ“Œ Lazy-loading UI frames for better performance on complex applications. ðŸ“Œ Adding a settings menu for dynamic QSS style changes. ðŸ“Œ Exploring dependency injection for better maintainability.
